# Data Structure Implementations
In this repository I have implemented the following data structures:
1. Singly Linked-List: NodeSSL.java and SinglyLinkedList.java
2. Stack: StackCDT.java, Operations: push(e): O(1), pop(): O(1), top(): O(1)
3. Queue: implemented using Doubly Linked List. Queue.java and DoublyLinkedList.java and NodeDLL.java
